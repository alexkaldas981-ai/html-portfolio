<h1>Hello! I am ALEX.</h1>

<p>
    I’m a curious learner with a wide range of interests that bridge creativity, technology, and personal growth.</br>
I’m currently studying psychology, history, and other areas of human understanding while also exploring the world of computer science and full-stack development.</br>
I enjoy breaking down complex topics into clear systems and structured notes, whether I’m studying, designing games, or working on new skills.</br>
</p>

<p>
Beyond academics, I have a strong creative side. I practice daily writing, focusing on mystery stories, and I enjoy designing board and digital games by imagining their rules, mechanics, and art styles.</br>
For me, writing and game design are not just hobbies but ways of combining logic with imagination.</br>
</p>
<p>
At the same time, I’m deeply reflective about identity and self-discovery.</br>
I ask questions not just to learn facts but to understand people, relationships, and the psychology behind our choices.</br>
Altogether, I see myself as both a thinker and a creator—someone building skills, knowledge, and self-expression step by step.</br>
